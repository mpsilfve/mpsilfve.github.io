<img src="me1.jpg" alt="Photo" width="200" align="right"/> I am a postdoc at the Department of Linguistics at University of Colorado Boulder after having defended my PhD thesis on morphological tagging in October 2016. I work in the fields of Natural language processing (NLP) and Computational linguistics. My research interests include NLP for morphologically complex languages, computational semantic, morphological tagging, parsing, and computational morphology.
