<img src="assets/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> My work mostly falls within the fields of Natural language processing (NLP) and Computational linguistics. My research interests include NLP for morphologically complex languages, computational semantics, morphological tagging, parsing, as well as computational phonology and morphology. I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/) (UBC). I am also a teacher in the Master of Data Science in Computational Linguistics or [MDS-CL](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/computational-linguistics) program at UBC. 

Until January 2020, I was a Lecturer of Language Technology at the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/) at the University of Helsinki. In Helsinki, I also worked in the [FoTran](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/found-in-translation/). Until September 2018 I was a postdoc at the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/) at University of Colorado Boulder working in the [CLEAR group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/). I got my PhD at the University of Helsinki in Finland, where I worked in the [Helsinki Finite-State Technology](http://hfst.github.io/) research group. In October 2016, I defended my PhD thesis on morphological tagging at the Department of Modern Languages at the University of Helsinki.
