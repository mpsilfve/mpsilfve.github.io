# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: Your awesome title
email: your-email@example.com
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

# Uncomment if you are planning to run the blog in a subdirectory
# Note - if you enable this, and attempt to view your site locally you have to use the baseurl in your local path.
# Example, you must use http://localhost:4000/path/to/blog
#baseurl: /path/to/blog

#### Under the Hood Stuff #####

# Use rdiscount as the markdown engine because it generates html5 compliant code for stuff like footnotes
# If you use maroku (default engine) some of your generated pages may not validate or lint as html5
# If you don't have it install it via gem install rdiscount
markdown: rdiscount

# Makes pretty (descriptive) permalinks. See Jekyll docs for alternatives.
permalink: pretty

# How many articles do you wish to appear on the front page:
paginate: 3

# Exclude metadata and development time dependencies (like Grunt plugins)
